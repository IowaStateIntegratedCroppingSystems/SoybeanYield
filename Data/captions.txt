<b>Figure 1.</b> Coverage of the soybean planting decision tool. 


<b>Figure 2.</b> Development timeline of soybean maturity group 2.5 planted on May 5th, June 5th and July 5th in central Iowa (Ames). The decision tool output shows the 25%, median, 75% percentiles (boxplots) and the 5% and 95% percentiles (whiskers) of when emergence (VE), flowering (R1), beginning grain fill (R5) and beginning physiological maturity (R7) are likely to occur for each planting date. The frequency of the first fall frost is indicated by the gray shaded area and the median fall frost date is indicated by the vertical dashed line. 
<b>Figure 3.</b> Simulated and measured data for flowering, start grain filling and maturity across a variety of experimental datasets covering different maturity groups and locations (see Archontoulis et al. 2014 for details).
<b>Figure 4.</b> Days from planting to flowering for two soybean maturity groups (2.0 and 4.0) as affected by temperature and latitude with a planting date of May 5th. Horizontal green dashed lines show the time from planting to flowering using actual central Iowa, Ames, weather data (16, 21, 23, and 22&deg;C average temperature for May, June, July and August, respectively, at 42&deg;N latitude). 
<b>Figure 5.</b> Relative yield response to maturity group selection for three locations and two planting dates (top = May 5th, bottom = June 5th). The vertical dotted lines indicate the most appropriate maturity group for each location and planting date.   
<b>Figure 6.</b> Relative yield response to planting date for two locations (top = Ames, bottom = Sutherland). The vertical dotted red lines indicate the optimum planting date for each location with a 2.5 maturity group selection. The non-linear regression curve (thick, red line) is a statistical fit of the simulated data (grey points). The red points represent 2014 field data. When the measured 2014 data points  are above the average line (average yields across 1980-2013) it means that soybeans performed better in 2014 compared to long term average

<b>Figure 7.</b> Simulated maximum actual and potential yields found across planting dates and maturity groups for 11 locations in Iowa, Minnesota and Missouri.
<b>Figure 8.</b> Simulated average actual and potential yields in Ames, Iowa from 1980 to 2013 at four planting dates and 12 maturity groups. The difference between potential and actual yield is the yield gap. 
<b>Figure 9.</b> Number of days with air temperature below 50&deg;F over the 30 days following planting (left) and simulated days from planting to emergence (right) at five regions. Each point is an average value across 34 years of data (1980â€“2013).  
<b>Figure 10.</b> Probability of minimum temperature being below 29&deg;F (frost risk) for spring (left) and fall (right) for five locations. Data points are the calculated probabilities using 34 years of weather data and lines are polynomial fits to the data (r<sup>2</sup>>0.99). 
<b>Figure 11.</b> Simulated failures due to low spring temperatures by the APSIM model for three regions. Each point is the average of 34 individual years for Minnesota and Missouri. For Iowa each point is the average of 9 locations over 34 years. Lines are polynomial fits to the data.
